        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Cameron has lived in St. Adelaide all of his life. The town has always been strange. Everyone
            here acts as if they are disconnected from reality, and they all dedicate their lives to serving the
            town, to the point that they don’t talk about much else. The only reason he can notice its
            strangeness is because he was <em>born outside of it</em>; his parents escaped and gave birth to him
            outside, but returned soon after and only spoke to Cameron about it once. He doesn’t know
            exactly what’s going on, but nevertheless, he’s chosen to not make it his business. The
            townspeople pay him no mind, so he’s chosen to just roll with it.</p>
        <p>That was until Casey moved in next door. They’d never met beforehand, but because of that
            Cameron knew he was an outsider. He’s seen the looks outsiders get in this town, and
            eventually he never sees them again. They barely get people visiting because the town is hard
            to find to begin with. Additionally, it’s hard to leave.</p>
        <p>Cameron chose to befriend Casey, who happily went along with it. He now has a new drive to
            help get him out of there. He isn’t sure why he’s so motivated after years of feeling detached,
            but he knows he doesn’t want to be complicit in any disturbing behavior from this town. He also
            starts to get hope that he, too, <strong>can escape.</strong></p>
        <p>Cameron and Casey work together to uncover the mysteries of this town so that they can get
            out. What they discover is that anyone who was born in the town falls under a curse that binds
            them to the town. While it is possible to escape, it is difficult to truly break off (as seen with
            Cameron’s parents). The townspeople believe that the town is lovely and anyone born outside
            of it must be corrupt. The townspeople <strong>sacrifice any outsiders to an entity</strong> which they worship,
            which they believe to be a holy figure, but is actually a monstrous creature that was created by
            the townspeople’s hatred and twisted hearts.</p>
        <p>Cameron and Casey learn through all of their research and experience together how to defeat
            the monster, effectively breaking the curse the town fell under. They also grow together at this
            time as they figure out what they want out of life, after being put into boxes by everyone around
            them who told them what they should do or how they should live their lives. They then are able
            to leave together and start a new fulfilling life, finally able to chase their dreams.

        <h2>Story Themes</h2>
        <!-- this is an html comment -->
        <p>This story stems from the fear surrounding one's identity and suppressing oneself to fit into their
            enviornment. The goal of this story is to emphasize the need for humans to be individuals, rather than
            changing yourself to 'fit in' with everyone else around you. Cameron struggles to truly be himself because
            of his environment, and through his relationship with Casey he realizes that he'd rather escape and be
            himself than to stay in an oppressive environment that doesn't allow him to be unique.</p>
        <p>Another theme of this story is an exploration of how we create excuses to harm others in order to feel like
            we are safe. The monster created by the town stemmed from their desire to protect themselves, and over time
            they create a collective belief that their sacrifices are justifiable because of ideas they created about
            outsiders to their town, and because they believe they need to survive. The truth is that the monster
            would've never been created had they not created such deep hatred towards people not like them, yet they
            continue to feed into the hate so they can feel protected.</p>
