        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>He was born outside of St. Adelaide and grew up in a well-adjusted family. While he faced
bullying in high school for traits outside of his control, he never let that change who he is. His
parents placed a lot of pressure on him to graduate college and work a high paying job,
regardless of whether it was what he wanted or not. Since he wants to make them proud, he
agrees to this. He maintains good grades in school and makes it on to college, where he finds
the pressure is too much for him. He eventually drops out and leaves home, after countless
nights of hearing his parents argue over his decisions. He takes a train hoping to enter a new
city, but instead stumbles into St. Adelaide. After days of trying to figure out how he could leave,
he gives up and settles in, using his remaining money to rent a cheap apartment and get a new
job, believing that after some time he’ll have enough money to catch the next train… whenever
that may be.
