    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>He is a resident of St. Adelaide who was born outside of the town’s curse, which means he has
a deep understanding that the town itself is not normal. He learned that it was best to assimilate
to the town after witnessing firsthand the experience of his parents, who failed to escape and
risked their lives only to fail. He’s also witnessed outsiders come into town, but he never saw
them leave, and was afraid that if he outed himself as having been born outside that he could be
in danger, too. He grew up relatively adjusted to the town and its people, who never suspected
him as anything but one of their own. But he knew that he wanted more out of life. He wanted to
experience higher education and follow his own passions, rather than feeling as though all he
can do is work meaningless jobs just to hold himself up. Believing he could never achieve this,
he continues on in an unfulfilling cycle where he’s only surviving and not living.
